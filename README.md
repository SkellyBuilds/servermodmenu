# Server Mod Menu
### A direct fork of [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) made for downloading and getting details of server mods

## Running and using this mod
It's pretty easy, download the mod's jar file and run minecraft.
No extra nonsense or dependencies to install just like the original modmenu mod.
<br>
**Dependencies**:
* Fabric Loader - Recommanding 0.16.0
* Minecraft - Currently 1.20.1 (I made this mod for a server i play with my friends so i want them to install mods easily :D. The server is 1.20.1)
<br> Although, an 1.21.2 version may release sometime or someday when this mod is finished with no odd bugs or issues
<br><br>**You should see a server mod's button, click it.
Since this mod needs to see the mods, i created a secondary server side mod named [SCMC](https://github.com/SkellyBuilds/scmc). Please suggest this mod to your server owner's if your server uses universal environment mods** 

## For server owners
You can download the appropriate version of [SCMC](https://github.com/SkellyBuilds/scmc) for your server, make sure to read the documentation so that you don't make your members download unnecessary server side mods that aren't flagged as server side only.

## Stuff that hasn't been worked on
* Translations - Switching the language that isn't EN_US will pretty make the mod chaotic. I will plan on making a crowdin as well but for now. Sorry :(
* Some bug fixes related to the GUI (Not anything related to the backend code like downloading, reloading and etc)

I hope you find this mod useful :D

## Not important but might help this project
If you already read, i have a host that runs a minecraft server and serveral of my stuff. This can be expensive so support could me alot while making this
